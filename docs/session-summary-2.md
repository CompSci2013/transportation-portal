git push gitlab main
```

**Explanation:**
- Push to GitLab self-hosted instance
- Syncs both remotes with the complete state management foundation

**Preview:** After this push completes, we have a natural stopping point. All state management infrastructure is complete and safely committed to both repositories.

## Session Summary

We've accomplished significant work today:

**Backend (Complete):**
- ✅ Enhanced search API with Elasticsearch aggregations
- ✅ Returns statistics in single API call (byManufacturer, modelsByManufacturer)
- ✅ Fixed corrupted controller file
- ✅ Deployed v1.1.1 to Kubernetes (2 pods running)
- ✅ Verified with Boeing search returning 42 aircraft and 15 models

**Frontend State Management (Complete):**
- ✅ Created 5 model interfaces (SearchFilters, SearchState, SearchStatistics, UserPreferences, + barrel)
- ✅ Implemented RouteStateService (URL synchronization)
- ✅ Implemented StorageService (backend user preferences API)
- ✅ Implemented StateManagementService (core orchestrator)
- ✅ Updated ApiService to use new types
- ✅ All committed and pushed to both remotes

**Next Session:**
1. Refactor existing aircraft-search component to use StateManagementService
2. Create new components: results-table, pagination, histogram (reusable)
3. Update search page layout to include all components
4. Test complete data flow: form → state → URL → API → statistics → histograms
5. Implement interactive histogram click behavior (manufacturer selection)

The foundation is solid and ready for component integration.
