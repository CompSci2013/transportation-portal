# Transportation Portal Project - Session Resume Prompt (Backend Complete)

## Project Context
You are assisting with the development of a **Transportation Data Portal** web application at **Halo Labs**, a self-hosted Kubernetes infrastructure. The project involves building a full-stack application to search and visualize transportation data (planes, trains, automobiles) stored in Elasticsearch.

## Current Project State (Updated: 2025-10-02)

### âœ… COMPLETED Components

**1. ETL Pipeline (100% Complete)**
   - Location: `/home/odin/projects/transportation/etl/` on Thor node
   - Python-based pipeline with Pydantic models
   - Successfully loaded 4,607 aircraft records into Elasticsearch
   - Full FAA dataset (~300,000 records) downloaded and ready
   - Container: `transport-etl:dev` available in Podman

**2. Backend API (100% Complete - NEW)**
   - Location: `/home/odin/projects/transportation/backend/` on Thor
   - **Production Deployment:** `http://transportation.minilab`
   - Node.js/Express REST API v1.0.0
   - Kubernetes: 2 replicas running in `transportation` namespace on Thor
   - Image: `localhost/transport-api:v1.0.0` (imported to K3s)

**Backend API Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check (API + Elasticsearch status)
- `GET /api/v1/info` - Service info and record count
- `GET /api/v1/aircraft` - Search with filters (manufacturer, model, year_min, year_max, state, from, size)
- `GET /api/v1/aircraft/:id` - Get single aircraft details
- `GET /api/v1/statistics` - Aggregate statistics (top manufacturers, states, years, aircraft types)

**3. Data Layer (Complete)**
   - Elasticsearch platform service at `http://thor:30398` (data namespace)
   - Index: `transport-unified` with 4,607 aircraft records
   - Health: GREEN status
   - Accessible to backend via K8s DNS: `elasticsearch.data.svc.cluster.local:9200`

**4. Infrastructure (Complete)**
   - Namespace: `transportation` created
   - DNS: `transportation.minilab` points to Loki (192.168.0.110)
   - Ingress: Traefik IngressRoute configured
   - Git: Code pushed to both GitHub and GitLab remotes

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS / NEXT STEPS

**Frontend Development (Not Started)**
   - Framework: Angular 13
   - Location: `/home/odin/projects/transportation/frontend/` (to be created)
   - Existing assets: State management services in `core/services/`

## Infrastructure Context (Halo Labs)

### Critical Policies
1. **Minimal Server Footprint**: NO direct package installations on host servers
2. **Container-First Development**: Build with Podman, deploy to K3s
3. **Image Management**: Podman build â†’ tar export â†’ K3s import â†’ Deploy with `imagePullPolicy: Never`

### Available Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes**: K3s cluster (Loki: control-plane, Thor: worker with GPU)
- **Elasticsearch**: Platform service at `thor:30398` (data namespace)
- **Container Runtime**: Podman (Thor) for building images
- **Development**: VS Code Remote-SSH from Windows workstation to Thor
- **Internal Domain**: `*.minilab` via `/etc/hosts`
- **Ingress**: Traefik v3 on Loki handling all `*.minilab` traffic

### Working Endpoints (Verified)
- Backend API: `http://transportation.minilab/health` âœ…
- Backend API: `http://transportation.minilab/api/v1/info` âœ…
- Backend API: `http://transportation.minilab/api/v1/aircraft` âœ…
- Backend API: `http://transportation.minilab/api/v1/statistics` âœ…

## Technical Stack

### Backend (âœ… Complete)
- Node.js 18 Alpine
- Express.js 4.18
- @elastic/elasticsearch 8.11
- JWT authentication ready (jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs)
- CORS configured
- Health checks: liveness + readiness probes

### Frontend (To Build)
- Angular 13 with routing
- Styling: SCSS
- State Management: Services in `core/services/`
- Build: Multi-stage Dockerfile with nginx
- Development: Hot-reload container on port 4200
- Production: nginx serving static files on port 80

### Deployment Pattern (Reference: TLE Tracker)
```
1. Create Angular project in container
2. Develop with hot-reload volume mount
3. Build production image (multi-stage: ng build + nginx)
4. Export to tar, import to K3s
5. Deploy with Deployment + Service + IngressRoute
6. Access via transportation.minilab
```

## Key Files for Reference

**Backend Configuration:**
- `.env` - Environment variables (Elasticsearch URL, JWT secret, CORS origin)
- `Dockerfile.prod` - Production build with non-root user

**Kubernetes Manifests:**
- All in `k8s/` directory
- Uses `nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/hostname: thor`
- Service type: ClusterIP (internal)
- Ingress: Traefik IngressRoute for external access

**Data Models** (from ETL):
- `common.py` - TransportBase with shared fields
- `planes.py` - PlaneTransport and PlaneData models
- Reference these for understanding data structure

## Session Resume Point

**Last Action**: Pushed complete backend API to GitHub and GitLab

**Current State**:
- Backend API fully operational in production
- 2 pods running successfully on Thor
- API accessible at `transportation.minilab`
- All endpoints tested and working

**Next Major Task**: Build Angular 13 frontend

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Create Angular 13 project (in container, not on host)
2. Set up development environment with hot-reload
3. Create services to consume backend API
4. Build search interface with filters
5. Create aircraft detail component
6. Build statistics dashboard
7. Containerize frontend (multi-stage build)
8. Deploy to Kubernetes

## Assistant Instructions

### Response Format (CRITICAL)
For each instruction:
1. **State the server** (Thor or Loki)
2. **Change directory first** (`cd ~/projects/transportation/...`)
3. **Provide the command**
4. **Explain what it does** (including flag meanings)
5. **Preview next steps**

### Development Principles
- ALL work in containers (respect minimal footprint policy)
- Follow TLE Tracker pattern for Angular deployment
- Use existing backend API endpoints
- Build production images with multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Import images to K3s, never pull from registries

### Context to Maintain
- This is a professional infrastructure project (Halo Labs)
- User is experienced with Kubernetes, containers, and development workflows
- Project follows established patterns from TLE Tracker and other services
- All services use `*.minilab` domain with Traefik ingress

---

**Assistant should acknowledge**:
- Backend API is production-ready and deployed
- Focus is now on Angular frontend development
- Reference existing working services (TLE Tracker) for patterns
- Maintain container-first approach throughout
