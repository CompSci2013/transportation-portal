## Session Summary: Angular 13 Frontend Development

### What We Accomplished

**1. Development Environment Setup**
- Created containerized Angular 13 development environment (Node.js 18 Alpine)
- Set up hot-reload development server accessible at `http://192.168.0.244:4200`
- Configured volume mounts for live code editing from host

**2. Angular Application Structure**
- Generated new Angular 13 project with routing and SCSS
- Created modular component architecture:
  - `AircraftSearchComponent` - Fully functional with filters and pagination
  - `AircraftDetailComponent` - Created (placeholder, not implemented yet)
  - `StatisticsDashboardComponent` - Created (placeholder, not implemented yet)

**3. API Integration**
- Built `ApiService` with methods for all backend endpoints
- Created TypeScript interfaces matching backend data models
- Configured environment files with API URL (`transportation.minilab/api/v1`)

**4. Search Functionality (Complete)**
- Filter form with manufacturer, model, year range, and state inputs
- Results table displaying 20 aircraft per page
- Pagination controls (previous/next)
- Professional styling with responsive grid layout
- Real-time search showing "1-20 of 807" results from backend

**5. Navigation & Routing**
- Header with navigation menu (Search Aircraft, Statistics)
- Route configuration for all three main views
- Active link highlighting

**6. Code Management**
- Committed all frontend work with descriptive message
- Pushed to both GitHub and GitLab remotes
- Renamed 'origin' to 'gitlab' for clarity

### Current Status

**Working:**
- Backend API at `transportation.minilab` (2 replicas)
- Frontend dev server at `192.168.0.244:4200`
- Search functionality with live data from Elasticsearch
- Navigation between components

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Aircraft detail view (component exists but empty)
- Statistics dashboard (component exists but empty)
- Production frontend Docker build
- Kubernetes deployment for frontend

### Next Session Tasks

When you're ready to continue:
1. Implement aircraft detail component
2. Implement statistics dashboard component
3. Create production Dockerfile (multi-stage: ng build + nginx)
4. Build production image and import to K3s
5. Deploy frontend to Kubernetes with Ingress

The development container will persist, so you can resume work by starting the container and dev server again.
